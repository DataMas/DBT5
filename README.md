# Databases Team 5

A team project consisting of a set of tasks given by a professor of ours, 
while attenting at the 'Databases' class of our University (DUTH).

This repository was created to sync up the files for our team project. It consists of an ER diagram of a mysql database for
a multi-clinic company, as well as a web-application that utilizes that database in order to provide some basic functionalities
for the clinic's staff.
